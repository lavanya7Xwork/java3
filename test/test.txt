1)Polymorphism is which mean “many” and “forms”, respectively. Hence, polymorphism meaning in Java refers to the ability of objects to take on many forms. 
In other words, it allows different objects to respond to the same message or method call in multiple ways.
2 types 
*method overloading:
If a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters, it is known as Method Overloading.
*method overriding:


3)Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. 
It is an important part of OOPs.
The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes. 
When you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and fields of the parent class.
you can add new methods and fields in your current class also.
Inheritance represents the his-A relationship which is also known as a parent-child relationship.
Examples:
class Lavanya{  
void food(){
System.out.println("eating...");}  
}  
class Manasa extends Lavanya{  
void give()
{
System.out.println("givingg...");}  
}  
class TestInheritance{  
public static void main(String args[]){  
Manasa m=new Manasa();  
m.give();  
m.food();  
}
}
